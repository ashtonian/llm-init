# Progress & Knowledge Accumulation

> This file is the persistent memory for LLM agents working on this project. Each iteration appends learnings here. Read the **Codebase Patterns** section before starting any work.

## Codebase Patterns

<!-- Consolidated patterns discovered across all iterations. Keep this section curated and deduplicated. Add new patterns here as you discover them. -->

_No patterns recorded yet. As you work, add discovered patterns, conventions, and important context here._

---

## Architecture Decisions

<!-- Record significant architectural choices so future agents understand the "why" behind the codebase. -->

_No decisions recorded yet. When you make a non-obvious architectural choice, document it here with context and rationale._

<!-- Example:
### {Date} - {Decision Title}
- **Context**: {What situation required a decision}
- **Decision**: {What was chosen}
- **Alternatives**: {What else was considered}
- **Rationale**: {Why this choice was made}
-->

---

## Known Issues

<!-- Track known bugs, tech debt, and issues that need attention. Remove entries when resolved. -->

_No known issues yet._

<!-- Example:
- **{Issue}**: {Description} — Severity: {low/medium/high} — Workaround: {if any}
-->

---

## Failed Approaches

<!-- Document approaches that were tried and didn't work, so future agents don't repeat them. -->

_No failed approaches recorded yet._

<!-- Example:
### {Date} - {What was attempted}
- **Goal**: {What we were trying to achieve}
- **Approach**: {What was tried}
- **Why it failed**: {Root cause}
- **Better alternative**: {What to do instead}
-->

---

## Environment Quirks

<!-- Platform-specific gotchas, tooling issues, and environment-specific notes. -->

_No quirks recorded yet._

<!-- Example:
- **{Tool/Platform}**: {Quirk description and workaround}
-->

---

## Iteration Log

<!-- Append new entries at the bottom. Each entry documents what was done and what was learned. -->

<!-- TEMPLATE — copy this block for each new iteration:

### {ISO Timestamp} - {Agent ID}

**Task**: {What was attempted}

**Stories/Items Completed**:
- {Item 1}
- {Item 2}

**Files Modified**:
- {path/to/file} - {what changed}

**Decisions Made**:
- {Decision}: {rationale}

**Learnings for Future Iterations**:
- {Pattern or gotcha that would help the next agent}
- {Convention discovered that should be followed}
- {Approach that worked or didn't work}

**Quality Checks**:
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Lint clean
- [ ] Build succeeds
