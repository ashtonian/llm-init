# Progress & Knowledge Accumulation

> This file is the persistent memory for LLM agents working on this project. Read the **Codebase Patterns** section before starting any work.

## Codebase Patterns

<!-- Consolidated patterns discovered across all iterations.
     CURATE this section: deduplicate, organize by topic, remove stale entries.
     After completing a task, promote reusable learnings here.
     This section should be a distilled, high-signal reference -- not a dump. -->

_No patterns recorded yet. As you work, add discovered patterns, conventions, and important context here._

---

## Architecture Decisions

<!-- Record significant architectural choices so future agents understand the "why" behind the codebase. -->

_No decisions recorded yet. When you make a non-obvious architectural choice, document it here with context and rationale._

<!-- Example:
### {Date} - {Decision Title}
- **Context**: {What situation required a decision}
- **Decision**: {What was chosen}
- **Alternatives**: {What else was considered}
- **Rationale**: {Why this choice was made}
-->

---

## Known Issues

<!-- Track known bugs, tech debt, and issues that need attention. Remove entries when resolved. -->

_No known issues yet._

<!-- Example:
- **{Issue}**: {Description} -- Severity: {low/medium/high} -- Workaround: {if any}
-->

---

## Failed Approaches

<!-- Document approaches that were tried and didn't work, so future agents don't repeat them. -->

_No failed approaches recorded yet._

<!-- Example:
### {Date} - {What was attempted}
- **Goal**: {What we were trying to achieve}
- **Approach**: {What was tried}
- **Why it failed**: {Root cause}
- **Better alternative**: {What to do instead}
-->

---

## Environment Quirks

<!-- Platform-specific gotchas, tooling issues, and environment-specific notes. -->

_No quirks recorded yet._

<!-- Example:
- **{Tool/Platform}**: {Quirk description and workaround}
-->
