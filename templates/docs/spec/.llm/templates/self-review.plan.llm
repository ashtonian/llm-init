# Plan: LLM System Self-Review

> Use this template to review and improve the LLM orchestration system itself —
> the specs, templates, coordination docs, and tooling that guide agent behavior.
> This is how the system gets better over time.

## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Created** | {timestamp} |
| **Agent ID** | {agent-id} |
| **Status** | planning |
| **Priority** | {P1 — run periodically or when issues are noticed} |
| **Trigger** | {What prompted this review: routine, error discovered, new capability needed} |

---

## Objective

Review the LLM orchestration system for coherence, accuracy, completeness, and effectiveness. Fix issues and improve the system so future agents work more efficiently.

## Review Checklist

### 1. Cross-Reference Integrity

Verify all internal links and file references are valid:

- [ ] All file paths in `LLM.md` point to files that exist
- [ ] All file paths in `CLAUDE.md` point to files that exist
- [ ] All file paths in `llms.txt` point to files that exist
- [ ] All file paths in `framework/README.md` point to files that exist
- [ ] All file paths in `.llm/README.md` point to files that exist
- [ ] All plan templates reference only specs that exist (or clearly mark optional ones)
- [ ] `setup.sh` copies every file that exists in `templates/`
- [ ] All custom commands in `.claude/commands/` reference files that exist
- [ ] `SKILLS.md` lists all custom commands, MCP servers, scripts, and plan templates
- [ ] `SKILLS.md` is referenced from CLAUDE.md, LLM.md, llms.txt, and README.md

### 2. Workflow Consistency

Verify the same process is described the same way everywhere:

- [ ] Review loop steps (READ→ASSESS→IMPLEMENT→VERIFY→RECORD→COMMIT→NEXT) match across LLM.md, review.plan.llm, and CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Quality gate definitions are consistent (same commands, same criteria)
- [ ] Terminology is consistent ("quality gates" not "quality checks", "plan file" not "plan.llm file" inconsistently)
- [ ] User feedback checkpoints are present in all plan templates that need them

### 3. Placeholder Consistency

- [ ] All templates use `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` and `{{PROJECT_MODULE}}` format
- [ ] No hardcoded project names, paths, or credentials
- [ ] `setup.sh` `copy_template` function handles all placeholder replacement

### 4. Documentation Completeness

- [ ] README.md directory tree matches actual template structure
- [ ] All new files added since last review are reflected in README.md, llms.txt, and setup.sh
- [ ] Navigation indexes in LLM.md and llms.txt include all documents
- [ ] Every document has "Related Documentation" or equivalent backlinks

### 5. Context Efficiency

- [ ] CLAUDE.md is concise (<80 lines) — it loads every session
- [ ] LLM.md is manageable (<500 lines) — it's read every task
- [ ] No significant content duplication between files
- [ ] Templates don't include unnecessary boilerplate

### 6. Permission & Security Review

- [ ] `.claude/settings.json` allow list covers all needed operations
- [ ] `.claude/settings.json` deny list blocks all dangerous patterns
- [ ] No credentials or secrets in any template file
- [ ] MCP server configuration is secure

### 7. Effectiveness Assessment

Based on PROGRESS.md learnings:

- [ ] Are agents successfully following the review loop?
- [ ] Are agents finding the right specs for their tasks?
- [ ] Are there repeated failures or confusion patterns?
- [ ] Is PROGRESS.md accumulating useful knowledge?
- [ ] Are plan templates being used effectively?
