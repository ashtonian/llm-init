# Plan: From Idea to Spec — {Idea Name}

> Use this template when starting from scratch with just an idea. This guides the agent through
> research, spec creation, user feedback, and planning before any code is written.

## The Idea

{Describe the idea in 1-3 sentences as provided by the user}

---

## Phase 1: Research & Discovery

### 1.1 Understand the Domain

- [ ] Research the problem space (web search, existing solutions)
- [ ] Identify target users and their needs
- [ ] List key competitors or similar solutions
- [ ] Identify technical constraints and requirements

### 1.2 Technology Assessment

- [ ] Evaluate language/framework options
- [ ] Identify required infrastructure (DB, cache, messaging, etc.)
- [ ] Assess third-party services/APIs needed
- [ ] Consider deployment requirements

### 1.3 Summarize Findings

- [ ] Write research summary in `.llm-scratch/research-{idea-name}.md`

### USER CHECKPOINT 1

> **Present research findings to user.** Ask:
> - Does this match your vision?
> - Any constraints or preferences I should know?
> - Which technology stack do you prefer?

- [ ] User reviewed research
- [ ] User provided feedback
- [ ] Feedback incorporated

---

## Phase 2: Spec Creation

### 2.1 Business Spec

- [ ] Create `docs/spec/biz/{idea-name}.md` following `biz/README.md` template
  - Problem statement
  - Target users
  - Success metrics
  - Requirements (P0/P1/P2)
  - User stories

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

- [ ] Define system architecture (monolith vs services, data flow)
- [ ] Define data model (entities, relationships)
- [ ] Define API surface (endpoints, contracts)
- [ ] Define frontend structure (pages, components, state)
- [ ] Document architecture in `docs/spec/biz/{idea-name}.md` or a dedicated spec

### 2.3 Create Framework Specs (if needed)

- [ ] Create any missing framework specs needed for this project
  - Use `docs/spec/SPEC-WRITING-GUIDE.md` as template guide
  - Common: api-design.md, error-handling.md, data-access.md, models.md

### USER CHECKPOINT 2

> **Present specs to user for approval.** Ask:
> - Does the business spec capture your requirements?
> - Is the technical architecture appropriate?
> - Any features to add/remove/reprioritize?
> - Ready to proceed to implementation planning?

- [ ] User reviewed business spec
- [ ] User reviewed technical architecture
- [ ] User approved specs
- [ ] Feedback incorporated

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Planning

### 3.1 Break Into Milestones

- [ ] Define milestones (MVP, v1, v2, etc.)
- [ ] Each milestone should be independently deployable/testable
- [ ] Assign P0 requirements to MVP

### 3.2 Create Feature Plans

For each milestone, create plan files:

- [ ] `docs/spec/.llm/plans/milestone-1-{name}.plan.llm`
- [ ] `docs/spec/.llm/plans/milestone-2-{name}.plan.llm` (if applicable)

### 3.3 Define Execution Order

- [ ] Order features by dependency (what must be built first?)
- [ ] Identify which features can be built in parallel
- [ ] Update `docs/spec/LLM.md` with project-specific execution orders

### USER CHECKPOINT 3

> **Present implementation plan to user.** Ask:
> - Does the milestone breakdown make sense?
> - Is the priority order correct?
> - Ready to start building?

- [ ] User reviewed milestones
- [ ] User approved implementation plan
- [ ] Ready to execute

---

## Phase 4: Project Scaffolding

### 4.1 Initialize Project

- [ ] Create project directory structure
- [ ] Initialize version control (git init, .gitignore)
- [ ] Set up package management (go.mod, package.json, etc.)
- [ ] Configure linters and formatters
- [ ] Set up test framework

### 4.2 Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] Configure Docker services if needed (update docker-compose.yml)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD configuration (if applicable)
- [ ] Create initial database migrations

### 4.3 Quality Gate Verification

- [ ] Project builds from clean checkout
- [ ] Test framework runs (even with zero tests)
- [ ] Linter passes on empty project
- [ ] Git initial commit created

---

## Phase 5: Begin Implementation

Hand off to feature plan files created in Phase 3:

- [ ] Start with Milestone 1 plan
- [ ] Follow the review loop protocol (READ → ASSESS → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → RECORD → COMMIT → NEXT)
- [ ] Update PROGRESS.md after each iteration

---

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: {Topic}

- **Choice**: {decision}
- **Alternatives**: {considered}
- **Rationale**: {why}

---

## Progress Log

### {timestamp}

- Started: Idea intake
- Next: Phase 1 research

## Completion

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Phase 1 Complete** | {timestamp} |
| **Phase 2 Complete** | {timestamp} |
| **Phase 3 Complete** | {timestamp} |
| **Phase 4 Complete** | {timestamp} |
